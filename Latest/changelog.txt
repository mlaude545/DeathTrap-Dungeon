This is a hotfix update, meaning that a serious bug was discovered after
the release of DTD V2.9. This update aims to patch out the following issues:

-Fixed numerous flaws with the update system; the Windows version of the game
 would crash when viewing a new release's changelog, and all versions of the 
 game encountered issues when downloading updates.

-Fixed more menu-related bugs.

-Fixed a bug where save files the game was beaten under would display incorrectly
 sometimes.

The original changelog for DTD V2.9 can be found below:

====================================

-The story has finally been completed! See if you can overcome the challenge 
 and beat 
the game! You never know, you may unlock something cool as a reward…



-Much of the game’s artwork has been updated, and now looks much more detailed!



-Certain sections of the story have been entirely rewritten from scratch! This 
 is a needed 
change as the quality of my writing has increased since I initially 
 started working on the game.



-The system used for handling updates has been rebuilt from the ground up; it’s 
 now much 
simpler and allows for downloading updates straight through the game 
 without even having 
to launch your browser, in addition to some other cool features.

-The update server has also gone through some major changes, which allow for
 update checks to be much more reliable and speedy.



-The UI receives a much needed overhaul! Menus have been redesigned, dialog has 
 been 
rewritten... pretty much every single UI element has been retouched; the 
 result it an interface 
that feels both fresh and familiar, and is more consistent 
 than ever before.



-Error messages have all been revised; the wording has been tweaked to make the 
 problem 
easier to diagnose, and additional options have been added allowing you to 
 see the exact cause 
of the error, or even get help online.

-The entirety of the soundtrack has been remixed and re-recorded; these new mixes follow
 all the same motifs as the classic soundtrack and are instantly recogniseable by veteran
 players, however the new sound is fresher than ever.



-Improved error support; errors are now logged to a file, making finding help easier
 than ever!



-A new feature has been added to the “Options” screen, allowing you to report any bugs 
 you may 
encounter! 



-A new feature has been added, which optimises the game for use on smaller displays! 
 To enable 
this, enter the Options screen and select “Display Settings”, then choose 
 “Optimise for smaller 
display”.



-Added a new ‘Examine’ option during battles! This allows you to instantly check handy 
 info, such
as the enemy’s health, attack damage, and even their held item!



-Many quality-of-life improvements across the board; faster load times, speedier navigation… 
 it
 all adds up to make the game even more enjoyable.



-The game now sports a new logo!



-Downloading and installing modules from within the game just got a whole lot easier! The 
 entire
 system has been re-engineered; modules now download far quicker, and the experience 
 has been
 streamlined.



-Save Data Conversion Utility has been upgraded to V1.7! This update brings support for upgrading

 save data created in DTD V2.8 to the new save format used in this version, as well as performance

 and stability improvements.



-Save Data Recovery Utility has been upgraded to V1.5! This update brings support for the new 

 save format in use in this version of the game, as well as performance and stability 
 enhancements.



-Certain sections of the game with delays between lines have been sped up.



-The post-battle screen has been redesigned; items dropped by guards now give detailed 
 descriptions 
on what they do/what stats they affect.



-Many new tracks have been added! Namely the final boss theme, the credits theme, the 
 post-credits
 theme, and many more.

====================================



So there it is; the huge list of everything new in DeathTrap Dungeon V2.9! As briefly 
mentioned above,
the loss of Mr. Chapple is what sparked me to finish this game; if it 
wasn’t for him, this game wouldn’t
even exist. I still can’t get over how far this game 
has come, and without the continued support of him
and many other people, it would never
have been possible.



Also, this release is planned to be the final major release of DeathTrap Dungeon, 
with a bugfix update
planned for the near future. It’s gonna be a shame to leave 
this game in the past, but rest assured this
won’t be the last time you see my name 
on a piece of software. I owe so much to this game; the amount 
of stuff I’ve learned 
whilst working on it over the past three years is truly something.



And finally, thanks to you, the player; by simply playing this game, you’ve fuelled my passion 
for programming
and have acted as the major driving force behind the game being in the finished 
state it’s in now. It 
wouldn’t have ever been possible without you, and I hope you stick around
for my future projects.



Hey, thanks for reading this far! As always, please be sure to report any bugs you may encounter, 
and 
enjoy the game!
