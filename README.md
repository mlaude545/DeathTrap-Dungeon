Welcome to the DeathTrap Dungeon repo on GitHub! This readme file contains some useful
hints to help you find your way around.


== General Layout == 
All files related to the latest stable version can be found in /Latest/. For beta versions, 
all of these files can be found in /Testing/Beta/. 
If you're in the Latest directory, the 'changelog' file contians the list of changes that
apply to that version of DTD. The 'sfx' folder contains audio data used by the game. The file
'DTD.py' is, of course, the game itself.
Alternatively, if you are in the /Testing/Beta folder, there are a few differences. The file
titled 'Dev log' is a comprehensive list of changes that apply to the beta releases; these changes
can either be implemented, in the works, or not started (this is detailed in the file.) The 
file 'changelog' lists changes that have been implemented in the latest Beta version. Note that
the Dev Log differs from the Changelog - The Dev Log is more focused on the progress of each
DTD 'series' as a whole, whereas the changelog is specific to the current beta (for example,
the current Dev Log lays out a clear roadmap for the DTD v3.x.x series as a whole.)
