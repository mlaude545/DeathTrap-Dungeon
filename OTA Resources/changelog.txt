Welcome to DeathTrap Dungeon v3.0.0! This is a massive release; I originally
only planned this to be a small bugfix update to DTD v2.9.5, however this
plan changed when I realised there was still work to be done to the game.
As such, this has shaped up to be the biggest release of the game since the
initial version launched back in 2019.

So, buckle up because this is gonna be a pretty sizeable changelog! You'll
also notice that I have now organised the changelog into categories, which
makes it much easier to read. Plus, if you don't care about a certain section,
you can now just skip over it entirely.

Anyways, enough waffle, here's what's new:

===============================================================================

NEW FEATURES:
- Introducing Expert Mode, a new game mode unlocked after beating the game! Expert
 Mode sees you play through the game with no checkpoints, basic stats and items,
 and more. See if you can become a true DTD master and overcome the challenge!

- The game now features an all-new UI (named 'Flow')! Flow is now the
 default menu theme in the game. It leverages Unicode characters to form
 bold lines and subtle gradients.

- The game also features two other menu themes that completely change the look and
 feel of the game! These include Classic theme, perfect for those of you who are feeling
 nostalgic for older versions of DTD; and Flow Basic, a modern theme that is easy on
 the eyes! Go to Settings > Graphics > Change Theme to apply them!

- Added a new Basic Graphics Mode, aimed at systems which cannot render the Unicode
 characters used for both the Flow theme and for various in-game graphics. This is enabled
 automatically if it is needed, but can also be enabled manually in Settings if desired.

- Tonnes - and I mean TONNES - of improvements and optimisations to the game under the hood.
 Listing them all would be impossible, but many sections of the game engine have been
 re-written from scratch. As a result, the game is far more stable, much more
 efficient, and the source code is far easier to understand and maintain.

- Added a new 'Gameplay' option in the Settings menu, which enables you to change many
 game-related settings! This menu can be used to change the balancing of the game,
 control how gameplay is saved, and more.

- A preview of your save file is now shown before loading or deleting a saved game.
 It shows progress, held items, defensive items, and more - meaning you know exactly 
 which save file you're about to load or delete.

- You can now access extras unlocked after beating the game right from the main menu! You
 now simply select 'Extras', instead of having to load the specific save file you beat the
 game with.

- Added a new critical hit mechanic, which adds a new layer of challenge to the game.

- Added an 'Advanced' option in the settings menu! This allows you to troubleshoot
 issues, see diagnostic data, and fix common problems when playing DTD.

- The Music Player (unlocked after beating the game) receives a much needed facelift!
 More songs are included, and the new 'Now Playing' screen shows information
 about the currently playing track.

- Reworked the update system from the ground up. You can now choose a custom download
 directory in the Source Code version. The Windows version has also received some needed
 attention; it now updates via a separate process, meaning that upgrades are now fully
 automatic (you no longer have to go through the installer after the update has downloaded.)
 
- Massively improved crash and error handling. The game now shows more detailed error info,
 along with clear options to get help, or report a bug.
 
- Re-wrote the final boss fight from scratch, making it more balanced, fair, and challenging.

- Re-wrote many chapters, improving wording and making them more challenging.

- When using the 'Examine' option during a battle, your stats are now shown alongside the
 enemy's stats!


SMALLER FEATURES / QUALITY OF LIFE IMPROVEMENTS:
- Increased spacing between dialogues and messages to aid with readability.

- Removed certain prompts from error messages and dialogues, which makes them
 easier to read.

- Loads of performance improvements and speed optimisations thanks to refactoring
 the code. From navigating menus, to loading save files, everything now feels so
 much faster.

- Removed the Player Profile menu, as it is no longer needed with the new save
 data preview feature.

- Save Data Conversion utility is now far better integrated into
 the game, and has been re-written almost entirely from the ground up. It now
 works much faster, has a higher success rate and wider compatibility.

- Renamed the 'Options' menu to 'Settings'.

- The ability to download and install the Pygame module in-game has been removed due
 to security, stability and maintenance concerns. (See here for more information:
 https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#using-pip-from-your-program)

- Added an option in the 'Gameplay' menu, which allows you to configure how the game
 handles saving. You can turn off confirmation when overwriting an existing save
 file, or write protect save files to prevent them from being overwritten.

- When changing settings, changes are now saved in the background, which means you
 no longer have to wait for the setting to be applied to continue.
 
- A prompt is now shown before submitting a bug report, which lists diagnostic data
 that greatly helps when fixing bugs. The game now asks the user to include this
 data in their bug report.

- A new save format is now in use, which improves efficiency and decreases
 load times. It also removes many legacy values that were needed in older versions of
 DTD but are no longer required, which means saved games occupy less disk space.

- Removed Small Display Mode, due to incompatibilities with the latest operating
 systems.

- Added a new "Refresh" option, which erases unneeded data files, logs, and other
 temporary files to reduce the game's footprint and fix certain issues. To access it,
 go to Settings > Advanced > Refresh.

- Added an option to reset all settings to their defaults. To access this, go to
 Settings > Advanced > Default Settings.

- Completely re-engineered the audio system; the game's audio files are now not
 only higher quality, but occupy far less disk space.

- Removed the Windows Themes option from the extras unlocked when the game is beaten,
 due to compatibility issues on newer versions of Windows.

- Updates now download and install much faster thanks to the updater code being
 re-written. (Like insanely faster - around 89% faster for the Windows version! *)

- When a new version is available, the game now shows the new version number in
 the update dialogue. It also now shows the version of the game that you're currently on.

- Moved several options around in the Settings menu, and renamed many options, to
 make the menu more approachable for new users.

- Removed nested menus from within certain menus and submenus. This makes navigation
 much faster, as well as making the menus more informative at a glance (for example,
 'Mute / Unmute Audio' from previous versions is now just 'Mute Audio' or 'Unmute
 Audio', depending on what state the audio is in.)

- Altered the behaviour of the Hyper Potion. It now temporarily raises both your
 attack and defence levels to 25 - before it only affected attack. It can also be
 used during the final boss fight now!

- The game no longer attempts to resize the window if it is detected that you are
 not using a Windows operating system. This means that error output that was shown on
 startup in most previous versions of the game is no longer shown! (This output
 was harmless, but annoying.)


BUGFIXES:
- Fixed a major bug where the Windows version of the game wouldn't start on
 newer versions of the OS. This fix has also been backported to DTD v2.9.5.

- Fixed a bug where certain corrupted save data would cause the game to crash,
 even if it wasn't loaded.

- Fixed a bug where Save Data Conversion Utility could corrupt save data under
 certain circumstances.

- Fixed a bug where checking for updates would return a "Server cannot be reached"
 error message, even with an active internet connection.

- Fixed a bug where the game would crash when examining certain chests.

- Fixed a bug where a battle could be triggered when examining the chest
 before the High Ranking Guard.

- Fixed many weird scaling issues when running the game on Mac or Linux.

- Fixed a bug where automatic update checks could sometimes leave the game in
 an extremely unstable state.

- Fixed issues where player stats could be displayed incorrectly if a save file was
 loaded, then a new game was started.

- Fixed a bug where audio would play even if it was muted on the post-credits
 screen.

- Fixed an issue where some menus would crash the game if the player entered an
 invalid option, followed by a valid option immediately after.

- Fixed a bug which meant that the quantity of inventory items would not update
 correctly sometimes when using or gaining an item.

- Fixed a longstanding issue where not entering anything on menus could sometimes cause
 the game to freeze, and then crash.

- Fixed a bug where the game would sometimes allow you to delete a save file that
 didn't exist.

- Fixed a bug where the developer option 'Error Logging' could sometimes be enabled on
 it's own, which led to the game becoming massively unstable.

- Fixed a longstanding issue where battles could sometimes continue after the enemy
 had been defeated.

- Fixed a bug which would cause the incorrect defensive items to be shown during battles.

- Fixed a bug when successfully escaping from battles would cause the game to act in
 strange ways.

- Fixed a longstanding issue where some menus would display using an older style,
 which made the menus look inconsistent.

- Fixed a bug where the game could sometimes take a long time to start with Auto Updates
 enabled if the connection to the internet was unstable.
 
- Fixed a bug where starting a new game, creating a character, then immediately quitting to
 the main menu would lead to the incorrect stats and items being displayed across the game.
 
- Fixed a bug where some submenus within the 'Settings' menu would return to the main menu,
 instead of back to the previous menu as expected.

- Fixed a bug where players could enter an invalid name if you chose to change
 your name before starting a new game.

- Fixed several memory leaks, which would cause the game to use high system resources resulting
 in sluggish performance at best, and instability at worst. 

- Fixed a bug where the game would freeze sometimes after defeating the High Ranking
 Guard at the end of Chapter Four. 

===============================================================================

So there it is, the massive list of all that's new in DTD v3.0.0! Thanks for
your continued support for all these years, the game wouldn't be where it is
now without your help.

I am also taking this opportunity to change the release cycle. Before, I would
release major updates occasionally, and increment the version number by 0.1 (for
example, DTD v2.8 to v2.9). Very rarely I would release an interim release to
address major bugs, but this approach meant that bugfixes were extremely slow to
roll out.

To address this issue, the new release model will still increment the version
number by 0.1 for major releases, however I will aim to release regular bugfix
updates and patches. These will focus solely on fixing bugs, not adding anything
new. For example, this is DTD v3.0.0, the bugfixes will be released in the format
v3.0.1. The next major update will be DTD v3.1.0.



* This figure was worked out using download times of 4 mins 21 seconds to completely install
 an update in the last stable release (DTD v2.9.5), vs 28 seconds on the new updater on 
 the Windows version. This figure will undoubtedly vary depending on a number of factors, 
 such as your internet speed.
