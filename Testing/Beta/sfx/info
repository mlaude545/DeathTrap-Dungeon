IMPORTANT:
This verison of the SFX folder is different than the one featured in DTD 2.9.5 - audio now uses a different format for 
audio (.ogg as opposed to .mp3 and .wav). Additionally, several filenames have been changed. If you are beta testing
DTD, please make sure you use this SFX folder only for beta versions and not for stable versions - the file structures
are not cross compatible, so you may encounter a whole range of errors and crashes.
