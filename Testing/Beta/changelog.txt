CHANGELOG:

Welcome to DeathTrap Dungeon v3.0.1 - the first patch for version 3 of 
the game!

DTD v3.0.0 was released last week and so far has proved to be extremely
stable! I am super happy with how the release went and I really hope
it lived up to expectations.

Regardless of how stable the first release in the DTD v3.0.0 series was
however, there will always be some bugs that slipped through! This
update is a smaller 'interim' release; designed to patch some bugs and
introduce some minor changes to improve the user experience.

So, let's see what's new this time around!

===============================================================================

BUGS FIXED:
- Fixed a major issue when escaping from battles by using the 'Run' option
 didn't work.

- Fixed several crashes that could occur after battles if the Pygame
 dependency was missing.

- Made the game more resilient to crashes when a corrupted save file was
 present.

- Fixed a minor visual bug where the 'Audio is muted' message shown
 when you start a new game wasn't displayed in the correct syle if
 a different theme was active.

- Fixed an issue where you could use the Smokescreen item during the
 final fight, when this shouldn't be possible.

- Fixed some stability issues in the inventory.

- Fixed several menus that could cause the game to crash if you made
 an invalid selection, then a valid one immediately after.

- Fixed several crashes that could occur if you made certain choices
 at the start of Chapter 2.


OTHER SMALLER CHANGES:
- Add a newline to the start of the 'disable basic graphics' prompt.

- Add a newline to the main menu in the Basic or Classic style to make
 it more consistent to the Flow appearance.

- Reworded the warning shown before you manually enable Basic Graphics mode
 to make it slightly more clear what the mode actually does and when it should
 be used.

- Made some optimisations to the code under the hood; removed some references
 to depreciated global variables and left several more comments to make the 
 source code more readable.
