DTD 3 DEV LOG:
This is a list of the main things that I want to do with the release of DTD 3.0.0


TO DO:
Below you'll find a list of things that are currently in the works. The comments in [square brackets]
are the current state of the implementation.
- Fix Expert Mode. [COMPLETE - REQUIRES TESTING]
- Clean up legacy code.	[IN PROGRESS]
- Integrate items into some sort of class system (objects with attributes rather than a bunch of random 
variables floating around in the code.)	[MOSTLY COMPLETE, STILL MISSING SOME ITEMS]
	> Semi - complete, still got to integrate it fully.
- Complete the removal of older features:
	> Windows Themes [DONE]
	> Save Data Recovery Utility, backup save file creation [DONE]
	> 
- Add descriptions for tracks in the Audio Player. [IN PROGRESS]
- General bugfixes. [IN PROGRESS - REQUIRES PLAY TESTING]
- Fix the battle system; finish migrating enemies over to a native class system. [COMPLETE - REQUIRES TESTING]
- Add a "What's New?" option to the Advanced Settings menu. [NOT STARTED]
- Add a flag to the end of the DTD Identifier variable for the Windows Executable version. [POSTPONED TO FUTURE RELEASE]
	> IE: "DTD v3.0.0 Windows Executable" as opposed to just "DTD v3.0.0"
	> This will allow the check for dependencies to be much more reliable for the .dll files.
- Add support for the new save format in the Save Data Conversion Utility. [DONE]
- Depreciate all old battle functions (musicBattle, juniperMusic, encounterEnemyName, etc...) [DONE]
- Migrate in-game chests to the new search_chest function, and remove legacy code. [IN PROGRESS]

COMPLETED FEATURES / PATCHES:
Please note that this list isn't comprehensive; it's just additions effective from the writing of this list (2/2/24) - a full list of implementations can be found in the changelog.
- Migrated the save/load menus over to the new save system.
- Changed save format to better reflect the game's new codebase.
- Tied the legacy SavePoint variable to a Player attribute.
- Categorised the inventory into a dictionary, which is a Player attribute.
- Items are now in a class along with their artwork and descriptions, which hugely tidies up the code.
- Battles are now almost completely migrated over to the new system.
- Prompt is now shown to convert an incompatible save file.
- Save Data Conversion Utility updated to support the new save format.
- Depreciated the following:
	> MusicBattle, JuniperMusic
	> encounterGuard, encounterHighRank, encounterJuniper
- Added some descriptions to songs in the Audio Player.
- Defensive items (such as weapons obtained by defeating enemies) are now stored as an array, which is an
attribute of the Player class.
