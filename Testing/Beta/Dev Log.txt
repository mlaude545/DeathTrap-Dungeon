DTD 3 DEV LOG:
This is a list of the main things that I want to do with the release of DTD 3.0.0


TO DO:
- Fix Expert Mode.
- Clean up legacy code.
- Integrate items into some sort of class system (objects with attributes rather
than a bunch of random variables floating around in the code.)
	> Semi - complete, still got to integrate it fully.
- Complete the removal of older features (themes, certain global variables, old dev
tools, etc...)
	> Themes gone.
	> Debating the removal of the Save Data Conversion Utility? The save system is at a stable 			 point now and the chances of saves being corrupted accidentally is slim - it's just unnecessary overhead for a worst-case scenario that will probably never happen.
- Finish adding music player descriptions.
- General bugfixes.
- Fix the battle system; finish migrating enemies over to a native class system.
- Add a "What's New?" option to the Advanced Settings menu.
- Add a flag to the end of the DTD Identifier variable for the Windows Executable version. 
	> IE: "DTD v3.0.0 Windows Executable" as opposed to just "DTD v3.0.0"
	> This will allow the check for dependencies to be much more reliable for the .dll files.
- Add support for the new save format in the Save Data Conversion Utility.
- Depreciate all old battle functions (musicBattle, juniperMusic, encounterEnemyName, etc...)

COMPLETED FEATURES / PATCHES:
Please note that this list isn't comprehensive; it's just additions effective from the writing of this list (2/2/24) - a full list of implementations can be found in the changelog.
- Migrated the save/load menus over to the new save system.
- Changed save format to better reflect the game's new codebase.
- Tied the legacy SavePoint variable to a Player attribute.
- Categorised the inventory into a dictionary, which is a Player attribute.
- Items are now in a class along with their artwork and descriptions, which hugely tidies up the code.
- Battles are now almost completely migrated over to the new system.
- Prompt is now shown to convert an incompatible save file.
- Save Data Conversion Utility updated to support the new save format.
- Depreciated the following:
	> MusicBattle, JuniperMusic
	> encounterGuard, encounterHighRank, encounterJuniper
