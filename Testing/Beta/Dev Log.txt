DTD v3.0.1 DEV LOG:

This file is intended to help with the development of DTD v3.0.1. This release will be a smaller
interim release, so this dev log will mostly just contain small changes and bugs that need to be 
fixed.

===================================================

PROPOSED MINOR CHANGES:
This lists off the proposed minor changes that I plan to make for this release.

- Reduce the spoofed player stats when using the debug save option (or remove the option entirely.)
- Remove debug mode; hasn't really seen any active development for a few years now.
