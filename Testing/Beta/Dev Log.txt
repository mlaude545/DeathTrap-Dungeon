DTD 3 DEV LOG:
This is a list of the main things that I want to do with the release of DTD 3.0.0

Please note that DTD v3.0.0 has reached it's feature freeze, so no more game-changing features are planned
for this particular release; it's now mostly just bugfixes and general cleanup.


TO DO:
Below you'll find a list of things that are currently in the works. The comments in [square brackets] are the current state of the implementation.

- Clean up legacy variables, rename them to better follow Python best practice.	[IN PROGRESS]
- Add comments to the source code to make it easier to maintain. [IN PROGRESS]
- Integrate items into some sort of class system (objects with attributes rather than a bunch of random 
variables floating around in the code.)	[MOSTLY COMPLETE, NEEDS REFINEMENT]
	> Very nearly complete, still have to integrate it fully.
- Add descriptions for tracks in the Audio Player. [IN PROGRESS]
- General bugfixes. [IN PROGRESS - REQUIRES PLAY TESTING]
- Add a "What's New?" option to the Advanced Settings menu, which acts as the changelog. [NOT STARTED]
- Migrate in-game chests to the new search_chest function, and remove legacy code. [MOSTLY DONE]
- Migrate the old self-hosted bug tracking system to Bugzilla. [IN TESTING]

COMPLETED FEATURES / PATCHES:
Please note that this list isn't comprehensive; it's just additions effective from the writing of this list (2/2/24) - a full list of implementations can be found in the changelog.

- Migrated the save/load menus over to the new save system.
- Changed save format to better reflect the game's new codebase.
- Tied the legacy SavePoint variable to a Player attribute.
- Categorised the inventory into a dictionary, which is a Player attribute.
- Items are now in a class along with their artwork and descriptions, which hugely tidies up the code.
- Battles are now almost completely migrated over to the new system.
- Prompt is now shown to convert an incompatible save file.
- Depreciated the following legacy battle logic functions:
	> MusicBattle, JuniperMusic, encounterGuard, encounterHighRank, encounterJuniper
- Added some descriptions to songs in the Audio Player.
- Defensive items (such as weapons obtained by defeating enemies) are now stored as an array, which is an
attribute of the Player class. 
- Fully implement Expert Mode. [COMPLETE - REQUIRES TESTING]
- Complete the removal of obsoleted features:
	> Windows Themes [DONE]
	> Save Data Recovery Utility, backup save file creation [DONE]
- Fix the battle system; finish migrating enemies over to a native class system. [COMPLETE - REQUIRES TESTING]
- Update Save Data Conversion Utility to support new save format. [DONE]
- Auto updates are now initiated in a more controlled way.
- Re-write the update system from scratch, which brings many benefits:
	> The Windows version of the game updates through a standalone program, which downloads the latest version's .exe file directly from GitHub, and overwrites the older version with this data. This has many benefits such as way faster downloads as well as being a true in-place upgrade (wasn't how it worked before.)
	> The Source Code version now lets you save to a custom directory rather than forcing you to use ~/Downloads.
- Re-worked the 'Refresh' option to avoid issues which may have led to mass file deletion and data loss in the Source Code version (not ideal!)
