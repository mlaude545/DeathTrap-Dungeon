DTD 3 DEV LOG:
This file is essentially a todo; it contains all of the changes and fixes that need
to be implemented into DTD before we can go live with v3.0.0.

To do:
- Fix Expert Mode.
- Clean up legacy code.
- Integrate items into some sort of class system (objects with attributes rather
than a bunch of ranodm variables floating around in the code.)
- Complete the removal of older features (themes, certain global variables, old dev
tools, etc...)
- Finish adding music player descriptions.
- General bugfixes.
- Fix the battle system; finish migrating enemies over to a native class system.
