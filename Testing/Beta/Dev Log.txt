DTD v3.0.1 DEV LOG:

This file is intended to help with the development of DTD v3.0.1. This release will be a smaller
interim release, so this dev log will mostly just contain small changes and bugs that need to be 
fixed.

===================================================

PROPOSED MINOR CHANGES:
This lists off the proposed minor changes that I plan to make for this release.

- Reduce the spoofed player stats when using the debug save option (or remove the option entirely.)
- Remove debug mode; hasn't really seen any active development for a few years now.



KNOWN BUGS:
Key: [ ] - I am aware of the bug but haven't fixed it yet.
     [x] - A patch has been implemented to address the bug.

- Trying to escape from first guard does not work - the guard keeps attacking. (MAJOR) []
- With classic theme enabled, the 'audio is muted' message still follows the Flow style. (MINOR VISUAL) []
- With classic theme enabled, the diagnostic screen (IE when you try reporting a bug) shows 'none' where the footer would normally
 be. (MINOR VISUAL) []
- When using the classic theme, the menu doesn't include a newline. (MINOR VISUAL) []
- You can use the Smokescreen during the Juniper fight, but this shouldn't work. (MAJOR) []
- The game crashes when you use the smokescreen and Pygame is missing. (Seems to be an issue with line 502) (MAJOR CRASH) []
- The game crashes when you escape from a battle and Pygame is missing. (Again, line 502.) (MAJOR CRASH) []
- Made the game more robust against crashes that could happen if corrupt save data was present. [x]
